</p>

Developed by Samarth Halyal and Daniel Quezada for [CSUF's CEDDI Lab](https://www.sampsonakwafuo.com/ceddi-lab)

## Project Overview ðŸ“‹
This project uses machine learning models and Shapley value analysis to identify which ecoclimatic features have the most significant impact on Lassa Fever outbreaks in Nigeria. The project includes code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

- Uses XGBoost and Random Forest Trees as models
- Aims to identify ecoclimatic features contributing to Lassa Fever outbreaks in Nigeria
- Data description, methodology, results, and conclusions included
